Make sure you have the super csv file!
taken from http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=superhero.htm

### To Do

* Write a Ruby program to open the `12-super.csv` file. (hint: require 'csv')
* Figure out the data structure in which you want to store the information, and read in the data.

Write methods for each of the following:

1. Return an array with just the names of all the films
* Return an array with all the films with X-men in the title. Return an array of hashes.
* Return an array with the names of all the studios with no repeats. `["WB", "Univ."]`
* Return an array with all the films with one word names.
* Return the number of films made by WB.
* Return an array with all of the film names and dates combined in one field if the film is from before 2016.
* Return a array of films in chronological order
* Return an array with the names of all the X-men films but replace the word X-men with X-people
* Return an array with the the names and opening weekends of films from biggest openeing to smallest

### Bonus

* Return an array with all of the films with man or men in the title
* Return a hash with studios as keys and arrays of films as values associating each movie to the correct studio
