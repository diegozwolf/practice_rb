### Arrays & Hashes review
**Given the following data structure:**

    users = {
      "Granger" => {
        :github => "cranbury",
        :favorite_numbers => [4, 100, 3],
      },
      "Nico" => {
        :github => "njasbon",
        :favorite_numbers => [2, 12, 11],
      },
      "Tchalla" => {
        :github => "tchalla",
        :favorite_numbers => [12, 14, 85],
      },
    }

1. How would you access Granger's Github handle (i.e. the string "cranbury")?
2. How would you add the number 7 to Nico's favorite numbers?
3. How would you add yourself to the users hash?
4. How would you return the array of Tchalla's favorite numbers?
5. How would you return the smallest of Granger's favorite numbers?
6. How would you return an array of Nico's favorite numbers that are also even?
7. How would you return an array of the favorite numbers common to all users?
8. How would you return an array containing all users' favorite numbers, sorted, and excluding duplicates?
9. How would you change Tchalla's favorite number 12 into the string "12"?
